# Linux-script-for-data-mining
This script assumes that the data is stored in a CSV file called data.csv. The script uses the head and tail commands to extract the header line and data from the file, respectively. The script then outputs the header line and data for demonstration purposes.

In a real-world scenario, you would perform more complex data mining tasks, such as data cleaning, filtering, aggregating, and transforming, to extract insights and information from the data. You could use tools such as awk, sed, or Python to perform these tasks.
